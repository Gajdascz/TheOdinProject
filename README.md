# TheOdinProject

A collection of all of my projects created while working through
[The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) open source curriculum.

## WIP

I just recently transitioned all of the individual projects into this repository and I will create a
unified page for the highlighted static projects and further documentation.
