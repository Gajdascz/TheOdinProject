# ChatExpress

Created as part of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-chatExpress), ChatExpress provides an introduction to local user authentication and web session management. The primary goal was to implement layered access to application features and data based on the [status](#Status) of a user.

**Live Preview:** [Deployed using Railway](https://chatexpress-production.up.railway.app/)

## User

A user is any individual currently accessing the application.

### Registration

Registering allows a user to send messages and potentially upgrade to member status.

- **Optional:** avatar image, first name, last name, email
- **Required:** username, password, password confirmation
  - _Provided password is hashed before being stored on the database and the confirmation is deleted immediately after it's validated._

### Status

User status defines the level of access a user has to the app's data and features.

- **Anonymous (not registered)**
  - View message history with redacted usernames and timestamps.
  - Register for an account.
- **Basic (registered)**
  - View message history with redacted usernames and timestamps.
  - Send Messages.
  - Upgrade to Member by answering the question in the `profile` page correctly.
- **Member**
  - View Message history with full details.
  - Send Messages.
  - Update user avatar once every 12 hours.
- **Admin**
  - Must be set directly in database.
  - Can do everything any other user can as well as delete messages.

## Learning Outcome

<details><summary> New</summary>

- **Authentication**
  - Configured and deployed a local authentication strategy using the `Passport.js` middleware.
    - Paired with `express-session` to persist authentication state across sessions.
    - Set up route authorization to securely control user access.
    - Implemented `bcrypt` password hashing.
- **Cloudinary**
  - **User Avatar Management:** Utilized the `Cloudinary` Node.js SDK to handle user avatar uploads.
    - Completed the "_Introduction to Cloudinary for Node.js Developers (90-Minute Course)_"
    - Leveraged transforms and inline CDN imports for efficient image storage, caching, and serving.
- **File Uploading**
  - **Multer:** Incorporated the `multer` middleware to parse image file uploads (multipart/form-data)
    - Stored the Buffer object containing the binary data in local memory.
  - **Streamifier:** Used `streamifier` to create a readable stream from the Multer Buffer Object.
    - Piped the stream data directly to cloudinary storage.
- **Handlebars**
  - **Configuration:** Configured and utilized the `Handlebars` template engine for server-side rendering.
  - **Features Used:** Partials, Layouts, and various Block/Built-in/Custom helpers.
- **Obscenity:** Integrated the Obscenity library to censor explicit messages.

<details><summary> Reinforced </summary>

- **AJAX**
  - **Client Side Scripting:** Configured client side scripts to handle server-side communication.
    - Enabled smooth dynamic interface updates.
    - Utilized a central `formHandler` to process post requests and server responses
- **Validation**
  - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implemented input sanitization and validation middleware using `express-validator`.
    - Ensured consistent and safe inputs from the user.
- **MongoDB/Mongoose**
  - **Schema Design and Document Management:** Created and structured document schemas using `Mongoose`.
    - Stored, managed, and executed queries on MongoDB documents.
    - Utilized Mongo's aggregation framework to retrieve and return specific data.
- **Deployment**
  - **Platform:** Deployed using [Railway](https://railway.app/).
    - Leveraged Railway's robust and intuitive platform to deploy and manage fullstack applications efficiently.
- **UML Class Diagrams**
  - **Tool:** Used [plantUML](https://plantuml.com/) to create UML Class diagram.
    - Planned the general structure of database document models.
- **Responsive Design**
  - **Device Accessibility:** Designed the application to be easily accessible across various device dimensions.
    - Incorporated dynamic CSS properties and a condensed mobile navigation for devices with smaller screens.
